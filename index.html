    <div class="subject">Subject: Urgent: Reconsider Termination of Principal Garmon at Broadway Elementary</div>
    
    <div class="greeting"><span class="emphasis">Dear Superintendent Carvalho:</span></div>
    
    <p>I am writing to express my strong opposition to the District's decision to remove Principal Garmon from Broadway Elementary School. As a parent at BES, I believe this decision is misguided and will ultimately harm our school and most importantly, the children. <span class="emphasis">More troubling, this appears to be a transparent attempt to scapegoat Principal Garmon for systemic failures that predate her tenure.</span></p>
    
    <p>Principal Garmon has demonstrated unwavering dedication to Broadway Elementary School throughout her tenure of over 10 years. Her commitment to our students, staff, and families has been evident even during the challenging circumstances of the past two years. She is a responsive, empathetic and tirelessly dedicated leader <span class="emphasis">who has been forced to manage crises not of her making.</span></p>
    
    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Principal Garmon possesses an irreplaceable understanding of Broadway Elementary's unique history and complex needs. She has witnessed firsthand the evolution of our school and the development of our dual language immersion programs. This institutional knowledge cannot be easily transferred to a new administrator who would be starting from scratch.</p>
    
    <p><span class="emphasis">The District seems determined to ignore a fundamental truth:</span> the complicated dynamics between our two language immersion programs have existed for over 10 years—long before Principal Garmon's leadership. These are systemic issues that require nuanced leadership and deep understanding of each program's distinct needs and challenges. Principal Garmon has navigated these complexities with skill and has worked diligently to bridge gaps between the programs, despite the constraints placed upon her by the District throughout her tenure following the UCP complaint filed only six weeks into her principalship.</p>
    
    <p><span class="emphasis">Rather than addressing the root causes of Broadway's challenges, the District appears intent on making Principal Garmon a convenient scapegoat.</span> Replacing her with an outsider who lacks this crucial background knowledge and experience with dual language immersion programs will exacerbate, rather than resolve, the underlying issues our school faces—issues she inherited (not created) due to decisions made by LAUSD over the years. The funding disparities, enrollment challenges, and program tensions that currently exist will not simply disappear with a change in leadership—they require thoughtful, informed solutions from someone who truly understands our school's unique context.</p>
    
    <p><span class="emphasis">This decision represents a failure of leadership at the District level.</span> Instead of confronting the difficult work of addressing systemic inequities and decades of poor planning, the District is taking the easy path of removing a dedicated principal who has spent over a decade trying to make the best of an impossible situation created by District policies.</p>
    
    <p>I demand the District reconsider this decision and instead work collaboratively with Principal Garmon to address the systemic issues that face our school. Her expertise, dedication, and institutional knowledge make her the right person to lead Broadway Elementary through these challenges.</p>
    
    <p><span class="emphasis">Stop ignoring the real issue – historical District decisions and actions, not her leadership, are the problem. Stop using Principal Garmon as a scapegoat for your own institutional failures.</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="emphasis">Removing Principal Garmon would devastate the school, continue the longstanding pattern of neglect that Broadway has received from LAUSD, and inflame, not reduce, the tensions that exist at Broadway Elementary.</span></p>
    
    <div class="closing">Sincerely,<br><br>[Your Name]</div>
